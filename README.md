# EDA-on-New-York-City-Ticket-violations
Exploratory Data Analysis on New York City Ticket violations Dataset


For your Project, using the same nyc-violations data, conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset and produce a report in your Jupyter Notebook describing insights gleaned from the dataset. Please note that this EDA report must contain appropriate visualizations, to show trends and insights gleaned.
